# disks-rs

This project began life in the [blsforme](https://github.com/serpent-os/blsforme) project for Serpent OS.
However as time went on it became clear we needed to extend the capabilities beyond simple topology scanning
and superblocks to support the installer and other use cases.

This is a WIP project to extend support for more disk configurations whilst providing backend support to the
blsforme project and installers like lichen.
